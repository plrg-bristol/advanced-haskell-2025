Advanced Haskell
================

Repo for [Jess](https://github.com/ratherforky) and [Sam](https://samfrohlich.github.io/)'s **Advanced Haskell Course**.

This course is optional without assessment or credit associated with it. We hope it will provide a no pressure learning environment, where hopefully we have some fun, and you pick up some functional programming skills along the way.

Course format:
---------------

We have a list of topics, split between us, and on the day, whoever is there picks what they want to hear about, and we will run an improvised session on that topic. If a topic needs another session to cover properly, we will continue it in the next session.

Topics:
--------

These topics are split into three categories: Advanced Haskell, More Advanced Haskell, and I Can't Believe It's Not Haskell! (for functional programming topics which are better demonstrated in another language or on a whiteboard).

Some topics follow on better from others and therefore have "prerequisites". Some topics are based on previous courses, so we can share worksheets that go with them if there is interest.
